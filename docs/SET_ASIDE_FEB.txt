    review
        a page
            writes to cookies
            action goes to wait for verify page
            javascript writes to firebasedb instantaneously
            verify email goes to a page with params
            if no topic key, returns to self
        a page
            if no topic key, returns to a
            if no validated email, returns to a
            if no validation key, returns to a
            writes to cookies
            action goes to .co/enroll.html
 - more carefully articulated index.html process for non-users .co
 - perhaps opportunity to "include" more parts of .info pages to reduce size
 - shell script for downloading latest on autocdsf windows box
 - clean up the crappola around main() and testing and random init stuff
 - should theoretically be able to delete stuff cause and all related cruft such as topic properties to delete
 - spin out data access stuff into behaviors?
 - fix the many quill content bugs
 - trim back undesired functionality from css file and from quill itself
 - I would eventually want to
    move from polymerfire query to straight javascript
    move db interaction into behaviors
    perhaps move some client side work into server side cleanup
        extracting content blurb
        cleaning up abandoned emails
    really need update/add functionality separated in auto
 - install promises functionality where applicable
 - misc javascript cleanupish refactoring
 - there is a possibility of a person enrolling with nuskin, even making an order, and not enrolling and thus still getting emails
 - the verify email is from "verify" and needs to be something less dorky
 - any bad actor can crash my server by passing in a wrong type from the browser in dev mode. Just saying.
 - would be better if db-combo whatever returned a hashtable instead of a list just saying
 - the values in topicType are custom changed by hand on fb UI and if this is lost so will they be
 - faq for topicType may be a higher priority than some other things
 - might want to write email as both html and text for some older clients
 - will definitely want to send css eventually with email
 - clouddancer.info and clouddancer.co index pages can't be avoided forever and are actually modest opportunities
 - using a profiler make sure that FetchSendEmailRepo isn't a memory leak...
 - shouldn't FetchSendEmailRepo also be writing log to servers
 - there is still a lot of my EmailThisOrThat naming which is confusing as hell
 - sendEmail.go("pete@clouddancer.co", "Pete Carapetyan" ........ instead needs to be sending from the user
 - document how instead you could use aweber and clickfunnels
 - in topic page put "notes to self" field in the summary at bottom
 - there is css that is not in shared, and vis-versa
 - fixing the red stuff in intellij html views would be helpful
