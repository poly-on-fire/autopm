I know it's been a while since I called. 

But I've been really busy trying to memorize all the different 
ways that Apache Camel works, so that I can pass the exam
and get Fortune 500 companies to get interested in hiring
me for contract work. I really like contract work.

It's kind of funny, Mom. Apache Camel is really so easy to
code in, you wouldn't think there would be that much to learn.
But the challenge lies in how wide it's capabilities reach.

Hopefully by Thanksgiving I will have time to call. Then maybe
we can visit you for Xmas holidays.

Love to Dad. The kids miss seeing their grandparents too!
